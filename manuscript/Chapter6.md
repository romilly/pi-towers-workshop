#What's next

If you want to explore the workbook later you will need a micro:bit and another
computer to program it. The *mu* editor runs on the Pi, but it is also
available for Microsoft Windows, MacOS and other versions of Linux. 


##More stuff the micro:bit can do

The micro:bit has a lot of additional hardware that we haven't covered in this
workshop. There's an accelerometer which can detect when the micro:bit is moved or shaken. 
There's an electronic compass which can tell you where North is.
There's a radio, which means that two more micro:bits can send signals to each
other.

There are Digital inputs which can be used to keep track of what's happening in
the outside world, and Digital Outputs which you can use to control more LEDs or
control motors.

There are Analog Inputs which can measure voltages, and you can use them with
sensors to measure how light or dark the room is, or whether it's hot or cold.

You can send information between the micro:bit and another computer, and you can connect
the micro:bit to other chips to add even more abilities.


##Where to find out more

You've seen a bit about how to program in Python but you can do much more
that you have had time to cover today.

There's a great free [Python Introduction](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/python-intro/)
on the Raspberry Pi website.

It shows you how to program in Python on the Raspberry Pi.
Python 3 on the Pi is the same language as MicroPython. The only difference is
that MicroPython has its own modules for controlling the micro:bit.

There are several places where you can find out more about the micro:bit.

* The [micro:bit foundation website](http://www.microbit.org/)
* The Raspberry Pi Foundation website has several worksheets in its
[learning section](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/).
I used some of their material at the start of this workbook.
* [microbit playground](https://microbit-playground.co.uk/)
* [RAREblog](http://blog.rareschool.com/) The place where I blog about my own experiments,
including a lot about the micro:bit, the Raspberry Pi and Robots.
* [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/rareblog) for tweets about robots, electronics, Arduino and micro:bit
