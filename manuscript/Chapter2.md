#Hello World!

##Typing in a program


In the **mu** editor, click the + (new) icon. You should see a new tab open in the editor. 

That's where you will type your code. 

The first program you'll run is the micro:bit version of _Hello World_. 

Here's the short program:

![Hello World program](images/hw.png)

Here's what each line means:

1.  `from microbit import *` tells MicroPython that you want to use the `microbit` module.
   (In Python, a module is some code that is already written, ready for you to use if you want to.)Â 
1.  `display.scroll('Hello World')` will scroll the string 'Hello World!' across the LEDs on the micro:bit.

###Save it, Flash it, Watch it run!

1. Now you can save your file. Click on *mu*'s `Save` button.
Call the file `hw.py`

1. Next, you need to use the mysterious `Flash` button.
Press the button and a dialogue box should appear:

   ![Flashing dialogue](images/flash.png)
   
   After a few seconds, another dialogue will open, telling you about the
   mountable file system. You can close both dialogues.

Once your program has been *flashed* (installed in the micro:bit's memory),
you should see 'Hello World' scroll across the LEDs on the front of
the micro:bit. 


###Troubleshooting

The display will finish quite quickly. If you missed it, just press the button that is
underneath the micro:bit next to the USB cable. This will restart the micro:bit and your program
will re-run.

If you don't see the display that you expected, here are some steps to help you
find out what went wrong.

1. Carefully check what you typed. It's easy to make a mistake, and the computer
cannot guess what you meant to type! If you spot a mistake, correct it and
flash the program again.

1. If you can't spot a mistake, ask someone else to check your program. It's often easier for them to spot a mistake
than it is for you, because you may be seeing what you meant to type rather than what is 
actually there!

1. If you're using this workbook in a workshop, ask the workshop leader.

1. If that doesn't help you can join this workbook's [private FaceBook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/microbit60mins/).

You'll have to ask to join; then you can ask your question.
Don't be embarrassed. Just about everyone makes some mistakes when they
program.
