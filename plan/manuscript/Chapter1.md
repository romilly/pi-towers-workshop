#Plugging in your micro:bit

The micro:bit has a micro USB port that you can use to connect it to your Raspberry Pi.
This will provide a power and data connection.

1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the micro:bit using a USB A-to-micro-B cable, as shown below:

1. You'll know that the micro:bit has connected to your Raspberry Pi, because a dialogue box should
pop up like the one below:

1. This dialogue box might pop up a few times while you're playing with the
micro:bit. You can simply click on `Cancel` when it does.

##  Using mu

The mu software has been designed with young learners in mind. It has a very easy to use interface,
and most of the menu items should be self-explanatory.
