#Hello World!

##Typing in a program


In the **mu **editor, click the + (new) icon. You should see a new tab open in the editor. 

That's where you will type your code. 

The first program you'll run is the micro:bit version of _Hello World_. 

Here's the short program:

Here's what each line means:

1.  `from microbit import *` tells MicroPython that you want to use the microbit module.
   (In Python, a module is some code that is already written, ready for you to use if you want to.)Â 
1.  `display.scroll('Hello World')` will scroll the string 'Hello World!' across the LEDs on the micro:bit.
