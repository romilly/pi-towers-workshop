## BBC micro:bit MicroPython workshop

*This is an independently created workshop. It has no official connection with the BBC, the Raspberry Pi foundation

The workshop based on this workbook was first delivered at the Raspberry Jam at Raspberry Pi Towers in
Cambridge, England on 11 Feb 2017.

I published this free book [on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/microbitmicropython) in order to make it easy for you to get
started with MicroPython on the micro:bit. If you get the (free) version on Leanpub, you will also
get future updates free.

To help me improve it, could you take five minutes to fill out a
[short online survey](https://goo.gl/forms/eeXtmhuQZISZ8VgZ2)?

## Publication process

I'm writing the workbook as a mind map (see plan/workshop-content.mm in this GitHub project).

I'm using my fm2md python script to convert the mindmap to Markdown in the
format required by Leanpub.
