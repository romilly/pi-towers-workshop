## BBC micro:bit MicroPython workshop

*This is an independently created workshop. It has no official connection with the BBC or the
micro:bit foundation.*

*All trademarks are the properties of their respective owners.*

The workshop is under development for delivery at the Raspberry Jam to be held at Raspberry Pi Towers in Cambridge, England on 11 Feb 2017.

Once the workshop has run, I will publish this worksheet as a free pdf under a CC/NC?SA license.

I plan to publish a longer workbook as a free eBook on Leanpub under a similar license.

## Publication process

I'm writing the workbook as a mind map (see plan/workshop-content.mm in this GitHub project).

I will then use my fm2md python script to convert the mindmap to Markdown in the
format required by Leanpub.
